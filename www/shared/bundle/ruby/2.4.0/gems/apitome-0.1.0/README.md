Apitome is a API documentation tool for Rails built on top of the great rspec DSL included in
[rspec_api_documentation](https://github.com/zipmark/rspec_api_documentation) (RAD). It's designed to display the
documentation generated by RAD in either a single page (with scrollspy), or on individual pages, and uses Bootstrap3 for
most of the basic styling and [highlight.js](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js) for code highlighting.

You can provide a markdown file that will be displayed as the README page, and by taking advantage of its modular view
structure you can override any number of views and partials to customize the output. You can also specify custom css and
javascript if you want to do fancier things or change how it looks.


## Installation

Add it to your Gemfile.

```ruby
gem "apitome"
```

Optionally run the install generator to get the initializer and an initial readme file (doc/api.md).

```
rails generate apitome:install
```

Update your `spec_helper.rb` to adjust how RAD outputs its results -- Apitome reads these JSON files to generate the
documentation.

```ruby
RspecApiDocumentation.configure do |config|
  config.format = :json
end
```


## Usage

You can view your documentation at the default `api/docs` route.


## Configuration

When you install Apitime an initializer file (app/config/initializers/apitome.rb) is generated that contains good
documentation for each configuration directive. Otherwise you can get a refresher by checking the
[Apitome Configuration](https://github.com/modeset/apitome/wiki/Apitome-Configuration) article.


## Customization

You can put custom views and partials in your own `views/apitome/docs` -- check the repo here for
[examples](https://github.com/modeset/apitome/tree/master/app/views/apitome/docs). You can put any partial in your own
path and they will be overridden.

Additional customization can come in the form of providing custom css and javascript. You can do this by creating the
files you want (that often times require the default assets in the gem), and then configure Apitome to use those instead
of the defaults.
